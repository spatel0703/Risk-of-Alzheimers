# Risk-of-Alzheimers
Worked on a project with two classmates that utilized a kaggle dataset to evaluate the risk of Alzheimers among patients. 
Group members were Anthony Shajan, Dulce Osorio, and Shrey Patel
This project was done completely in Python using data science ideas to build a data report on Alzheimers and the properties that go along with it.
